# How to create a pill

Each git pill consist in a markdown file under the `/pills` folder. In order to create a new pill, do the following steps:

- Create a new Markdown (`.md`) file with the name of your pill in the `/pills` folder.  
  File name example: `git-rebase.md`
- As title, use a `#` for the name of the pill. For secondary sections, use `##`.
- Go to `/pills/index.md` file and add your pill in the corresponding slot.
- Create a Pull Request, it will be deployed automatically after the pull request is accepted.

Every markdown extension you can use, is listed [here](https://vitepress.vuejs.org/guide/markdown.html).
